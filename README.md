Java Swing Snake Game:
A classic Snake Game implemented using Java Swing. 
This project provides a basic, functional game panel with core game mechanics, score tracking and collision detection.



Features:
Core gameplay: control a snake to eat "apples" and grow longer.
Collision detection: game over upon hitting borders or the snake's own body.
Dynamic design: uses random colors for the snake's body segments.
Score dracking: displays the current score based on the number of apples eaten (not yet working).
Configurable: key game parameters are easily adjustable via static constants.



Prerequisites:
This project consists of the core game logic (GamePanel.java) and requires a simple JFrame container to run.
Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or later.
